After starting the game the player chooses one among from the different number combinations. 

Numbers are arranged into two groups: 20 "small numbers" (two each of 1 to 10) and four "large numbers" of 25, 50, 75 and 100.

The player decides how many large numbers are to be used, from none to all four, after which the six number box are randomly placed on the page.

The player's objective is to reach the target number or find any number as close to the target number as possible.

They may use only the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and do not have to use all six numbers.

Division can only be performed if the result has no remainder.

Fractions are not allowed, and only positive integers may be obtained as a result at any stage of the calculation.

Player is able to undo the calculations or restart all operations.

When player submits his answer or his time is up, he gets points in accordance with his closeness to the target number.

  +10 Points  ->  Exact Target
  
  +7  Points  ->  1 and 5 from the Target
  
  +5  Points  ->  6 and 10 from the Target
  
  0   Points  ->  More than 10 from the Target

  The player could look at the solution, and compare it with his own solution if he was unsuccesful to find the target number exactly.
